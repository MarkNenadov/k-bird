k-bird
======

eBird data tools written in Kotlin. Includes tools to deal with EBD (Basic Dataset) as well as some scraper tools. 

scrape-recent-county-checklists.kt
* outputs recent checklists for a county in JSON format.

scrape-recent-hotspot-checklists.kt
* outputs recent checklists for a hotspot in JSON format.

scrape-hotspots
* outputs top hotspots for a county in json format

(At this point, this is just my first "let's play with Kotlin" project.)
